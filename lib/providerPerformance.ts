/**
 * Provider performance aggregates computed from closed signals.
 *
 * Calculation rules:
 * - Eligible signals are closed: outcome is WIN or LOSS.
 * - Incomplete outcomes (PENDING or any other value) are excluded from every
 *   rate and count of eligible signals. They are reported separately in
 *   `excludedIncomplete` so the UI can show how much history is still open.
 * - Win rate is wins / sampleCount * 100, or 0 when there are no eligible
 *   signals.
 * - The optional `from` / `to` ISO bounds are inclusive and are compared
 *   against each signal's timestamp. Signals with an unparseable timestamp
 *   fall outside any window and are skipped.
 * - `window` reports the earliest and latest timestamps of the eligible
 *   signals actually aggregated, or nulls when there are none.
 * - Samples smaller than MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE set `isLowSample`. The rate is still
 *   returned, but it should be presented as indicative only.
